Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is basically the act of communication with computers,which is basically done in codes (a language that the machine or computer understands.
its importance to technology is that it helps to make problem solving fast, and also provide solutions that woudnt have been humanly possible.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) OOP: when the evolution started with object oriented programming around 1980
2) The internet age, started aroud late 20th century, which led to the birth of web based applications
3) Cloud computing and Ai: this is the era of cloud computing where companies like Amazon, Microsoft etc provide scalable infastruture with new Ai integration

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) planning: before execution of any project, theres planning about the goals, scopes at which it covers and the objective of the project, those are some of the things considered in planning
2) design:this is where specifications and models are decided
3) implementation: this is the stage where the plans and implementation are put in place in the form of codes
4) Testing ; the written codes are tested
5) Deployment: once its be tested and proven to be good it pushed out for use
6) Mantenance: from time to time the developers check the codes of the product in use and update it or fix a bug.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
When to Use Waterfall
Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, where changes are unlikely, and a clear timeline is needed.
Examples include:
1.Construction Projects – Building structures follows a strict sequence (foundation, framework, wiring, etc.), making Waterfall ideal.
2.Government and Regulatory Projects – Compliance-heavy projects (e.g., tax systems) require strict documentation and predefined steps.
3.Manufacturing Software – Systems like factory automation software require extensive upfront planning.
4.Medical Device Development – Compliance with strict regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA approvals) necessitates a structured approach.

When to Use Agile
Agile is best for projects that require flexibility and frequent changes based on user feedback.
Examples include:
1.Software Startups – New product development often involves frequent iterations and evolving user needs.
2.Mobile App Development – Regular updates, bug fixes, and feature additions are common.
3.E-commerce Websites – Customer preferences and market trends drive continuous updates.
4.Game Development – Developers often test game mechanics iteratively and adjust based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
In a software development team, different roles contribute to building, testing, and deploying a software product. Here’s a breakdown of key roles of a software developer within the team:
1. front end developer
2. Back end developer
3. full stack developer
4. security engineer
5. data engineer ETC

   A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer plays a critical role in ensuring that software meets the required standards of functionality, performance, security, and usability before it is released.
    Below are the key responsibilities of a QA engineer in a software development team:

   1. Requirement analysis
   2. Team planing and strategy
   3. manual testing
   4. Bug tracking and reporting
   5. documentation and reporting

   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
